  <h3>Welcome to Gravendale City</h3>
  <p>This bustling city was once part of an even greater kingdom under the rule of Count Fahlslem; The Kingdom of Duhne. They were well known for their export of a rare mineral called Chrisym-Stone. Due to unfornate events the Count no longer lives and the kingdom has been reduced into this small city. The town's folk are terrified of going into his fortress north of the city and tales of monsters and ghosts permiate the streets.</p>

  <h2>Grimsythe Fortress</h2>
  <div id="floor1">

    <!-- display text floor 1 -->
    <p>You have entered the Grimsythe Fortress...</p>
    <p>The repugnent smell of blood and mold fills the air. You feel a chill run down your spine and get that feeling that <em>something</em>... <strong><em>somewhere</em><strong>... is watching you...</p>
    <p>You grip your weapon tightly. Sounds of howling wind creep through broken winds and dark corridors</p>

    <button class="exit-fort" type="button">Exit</button>
    <button class="move-ahead" type="button">Proceed</button>

  <div id="floor2">

    <!-- display text floor 2 -->
    <p>Moving forward, you now enter into what looks like a dining hall. The table is set with plates, silverware and cups. The spread over the table however; is rotten. From the looks of it, the count of this fortress and his mean were invaded before they could have their supper.</p>
    <p>You begin to wonder to yourself. What could of happened to the count and his men? What foul creature or evil force now haunts this once noble fortess?</p>
    <p>You hear a loud crash coming from the Count's main chamber! You loud screams of some foreign beast echo through the dining hall!! You get the feeling you are about to get the answer to your questions very soon. You gather up your courage and prepare yourself to investigate.</p>

  <div id="floor3">

    <!-- display text floor 3 -->
    <p>The Count's chamber is littered with golden and glittering items strewn about the floor, some of these covered in blood. You look up to meet eyes with the thing making the loud noises that echoed through the dining room and your mind.</p>
    <p>It is a <em>place-holder</em>!!!! It is now clear to you why people and travellers of the region have been talking about a mugger that has been killing and pillages valuables. This must be that mugger!</p>
    <p>The creature stands to full length, now towering over you. You recite an ancient prayer as you preapre for a challenging battle.</p>

<!-- cave -->
<div id="cave">
  <div id="level1">

    <!-- display text level1 -->
    <p>You have entered into the mouth of Chrisym-Stone Mines...</p>
    <p>A purple light glitters the walls of this cavern. Large crystals and sparkling rocks catch your eye. This mine, now abandoned, was once the main source of income for this region. Chrisym, the left over energy of dragons in crystalized form. This rare mineral is used to make magical weapons and armor, as well as in concoctions for rare potions and magical items.</p>
    <p>The gear of the miners can still be seen in the light of these magical stones.</p>
    <p>A part of you begins to wonder why this mine was abandoned. The thought of monsters or cave-ins puts you on edge.</p>
    <p>You gather up your courage and grip your weapon tightly as you prepare to delve deeper and deeper.</p>
    <!-- display text level1 -->

    <button class="exit-cave" type="button">Exit</button>
    <button class="move-ahead-cave" type="button">Proceed</button>

  </div>
  <div id="level2">

    <!-- display text level2 -->
    <p>Upon entering this room, you immediately realize that part of this mine has become flooded. You check around the cave for another path forward but quickly realize you may have to get wet to proceed.</p>
    <p>Unsure of what could be inside of dark muddy body of water, a sense of uneasiness begins to overwhelm you. The liquid is viscous and sticks to your armor, but you are still free to move forward.</p>
    <p>As you proceed the depth of this fluid grows deeper and deeper. Pretty soon you are up to your neck. After several minutes of wading through this disgusting marsh, you finally begin to climb higher. Ahead is a narrow passage way with a glowing green light coming from it's center. You don't know what lies ahead, but you are willing to press forward</p>

    <button class="move-ahead-cave2" type="button">Proceed</button>
  </div>
  <div id="level3">

<!-- display text level3 -->
<p>The narrow mouth of the cave opens up into a massive chamber. Inside the walls are glowing green with some sort of stone different than the others.</p>
<p>Suddenly a sort of portal opens up and a man cloked in foreign attire steps forth from it's mesmerizing spirals</p>
<p>This man is wearing a bandana. He asks you if you know where Otacon is, then if you know where they are holding Metal Gear. Unsure, you decline to answer.</p>
<p>The man hands you a strange weapon, and proceeds back into the portal. You dont remember the name he called it, but you decide to name it 'The Magic Missile'</p>
